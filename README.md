# The Chase
Implement the chase algorithm solver that takes in as input a xml file and outputs the solution in xml

# Quick start
To use the application, run the following command in the terminal
```zsh
python3 main.py [chase_type] path_to_input_file [path_to_output_file]
```
- main.py: the application that implements the chase algorithm
- chase_type: the version of chase to use, supports `simple` and `distinguished` chase (default to `distinguished`)
- path_to_input_file: the path to an xml file that describe the problem statement
- path_to_output_file: the path to an xml file that the result will be written to (default to `output.xml`)
